<h3>EECS 494 Project 1: The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<a href="WebBuild/webbuild.html" class="button">Play the Game</a>
<p>My Contributions: I implemented the wepons used by both Link and the enemies. I also worked on the movement, health, and other aspects of the entities. I added and assigned the sound effects to the appropriate times. I also spent time making the sprites of the enemies and other objects looked good and accurate. I assisted in the implementatino of the custom mechanic. Finally, I did some general debugging.</p>

<h3>EECS 494 Project 2: Gravity Bike</h3>
<a href="webbuild_gb/webbuild_gb.html" class="button">Play the Game</a>
<p>My Contributions: I created this entire game. The purpose of this porject was to create a game around a unique and novel game mechanic. For my game mechanic, I chose a bike racing game with a gravity shift component. I then created 10 levels to show off the different things that can be done with this concept.</p>
