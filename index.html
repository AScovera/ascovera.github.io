<p>My Contributions: I implemented the wepons used by both Link and the enemies. I also worked on the movement, health, and other aspects of the entities. I added and assigned the sound effects to the appropriate times. I also spent time making the sprites of the enemies and other objects looked good and accurate. I assisted in the implementatino of the custom mechanic. Finally, I did some general debugging.</p>
<p>Tools: Unity, C#, Photoshop, https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/legendofzelda/</p>
